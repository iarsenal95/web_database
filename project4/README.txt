Note:

1 . We build our PA4 using C++. 

All C++ related files (including input and output files) are in PA4/C++ folder
The inverted index file is named index.txt. The port we choose is 2000. After make, please use ./indexServer 2000 index.txt to run the index server. 

2. extraction code for search.xml in PA4/index/

how to use:
a. If you are testing our code with a empty database:
a1. run tb1_creat.sql to create tables
a2. run load_data.sql to load relative tuples for previous PAs
a3. run loadData.php in browser. You will see execution result displayed. The extraction for search.xml is finishied. 

b. If you are testing our code with database which has data of previous PAs:
b1. just run loadData.php in browser. You will see execution result displayed. The extraction for search.xml is finishied. 

3. similar photos are showed under the large image when user view a particular
